#Game of Life

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. I want to try implement the
"Semi-quantum Version of the Game of life" described in "Quantum Aspects of Life" 
(Abbott, Davies and Pati). I'll be building a "classical version" of the game of life
and implementing optimisations to make sure it runs reasonably fast, before implementing
the quantum version. 

Currently just randomly populates the map and then runs.

TODO: 
- benchmarking to locate bottlenecks. 
- wrap around so the space is continuous 
- Add ability to initialise from bit map or some other file? 
- Add history to record the session
- Add playback to play history
- Frame rate lock. If the process becomes more optimised, we want to be able to ensure we keep a consistent frame rate.



it actually worked omg
